<h2>Safe Housing </h2>

<strong>This project allows the user to search for housing and see the sexual offenders within the area.</strong>

With an interactive map, users may search through Volusia County to view housing, housing prices, and the sexual offenders in the 
surrounding area. 
This map allows users to either type in a known address or click an area to see what housing is available. An adjustable radius allows 
users to view the sexual offenders from 1 to 5 miles. 
A pin or marker on the map will indicate their last known location. When the user further inspects the pin, they will be propted with 
their last known address, status, crime, and name.

<h3>Using the Map!</h3>
To search for a known address use the search bar located in the upper right corner of the screen. If you arent sure of the full address, 
we will help you find what you are looking for through our autocomplete possible matches. 
If you dont have an address, you can pan and zoom around the map to find a desired area. Go ahead and click on this desired area and we 
will show you living options in the area. 
Once an address is input, you may choose a radius size. This radius will indicate sexual offenders and color coded pins will display the 
type of crime without having to search for it.
