Research on how to implement APIs:
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code.
In order to work with APIs in Python, we need tools that will make requests. In Python, the most common 
library for making requests and working with APIs is the requests library. 
The requests library isn’t part of the standard Python library, so you’ll need to install it to get started.
