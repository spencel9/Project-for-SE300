Research on how to implement APIs:
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code.
In order to work with APIs in Python, we need tools that will make requests. In Python, the most common 
library for making requests and working with APIs is the requests library. 
The requests library isn’t part of the standard Python library, so you’ll need to install it to get started.

response = requests.get("https://api.open-notify.org/this-api-doesnt-exist")

For Zillow API: 

import requests
url = "https://zillowdimashirokovv1.p.rapidapi.com/GetSearchResults.htm"
payload = "rentzestimate=true&rentzestimate=false&zws-id=<YOUR ZILLOW ID>&citystatezip=97525&address=583-N-5th-Ave-Gold-Hill-OR"
headers = {
    'x-rapidapi-host': "ZillowdimashirokovV1.p.rapidapi.com",
    'x-rapidapi-key': "YOUR RAPID API KEY",
    'content-type': "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
response = requests.request("POST", url, data=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)

getChart returns an HTML chart comprised of images and property data. 
getComps returns a list of recent, similar sales for a property.
getDeepComps returns a list of recent, deeply similar sales for a property.
getDeepSearchResults returns property for a given address.
getRegionChildren returns a list of regions that exist within the “parent” region provided in the request.
getSearchResults returns property for a given address.
getUpdatedPropertyDetails returns the most recently updated details provided by the homeowner.
getZestimate returns Zillow’s estimated values related to a given property (where exists).
